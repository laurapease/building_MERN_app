# Building a MERN App

The MERN stands for Mongo, Express, React and Node and is an acronym used to
describe applications build with that stack of technologies. React and it's
surrounding ecosystem (like Redux and React-Router) are just for the front-end
of the application. If we want to persist data to a database or have any other
back-end logic we need to (1) provide a separate back-end and (2) get the
front-end and back-end to communicate somehow.

In this lesson, we'll discuss two options for building full stack applications
using React on the front-end and Express, Mongo and Node on the back-end.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

* Describe the difference between single-server and multi-server configurations
  for an application built in the MERN stack
* Install and use `cors` to allow for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing between our
  front-end application and back-end API
* Build and deploy our front-end application
* Describe the process of connecting our front-end and back-end
* Set up our front-end development server to proxy requests to our back-end
  server
* Set up our back-end API to serve static `build` assets in production

## Introduction (10 min / 0:15)

To integrate React with a back-end framework (such as Express) we will need to
make a few decisions about the desired architecture of our application (how we
want to structure everything). The first primary decision to make is where we
want our front-end application to be served from. There are two primary options:

### Multi-Server Configuration

Our front-end application and back-end API will be completely separate, hosted
on separate servers even! They will each have their own Git repositories and
will be deployed independently to different servers. Our front-end will retrieve
data from our back-end (across separate domains) using AJAX.

#### Pros

* Separation of Concerns: Our application is more modular and our front-end and
  back-end developers can work on their parts of the application independent
  of each other.
* Specialized Configuration: Since our front-end and API will be hosted on
  separate servers, we can optimize server configuration for each one
  independently, allowing them to scale independently of each other and
  preventing them from competing for resources on the same server.

#### Cons

* Since requests will be sent across separate domains, we will have to configure
  CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for the browser to allow our front-end to
  retrieve data from our back-end

### Single-Server Configuration

Our front-end application will be housed in the same repository as our back-end
code. They will be deployed together to a single server where our back-end will
be responsible for serving up our front-end application in addition to our API
data.

#### Pros

* Single Deployment: Since our front-end will be served up by our API, we only
  need to manage one deployment.
* Unified Codebase: Since our front-end and back-end will be housed in the same
  Git repo, we will always have a more full picture of the application than if
  they were in separate repos.
* No CORS: Since our front-end application will be making requests back to the
  same domain that served it up (its 'origin'), we do not need to configure
  CORS.

#### Cons

* We will have to modify our server to serve up both json data for the API
  endpoints and the assets of our front-end which could require additional
  configuration and cause the two to compete over server resources.

Today, we will focus on setting up and deploying our application on separate
servers. This is more common and more straightforward.

## Getting Started (20 min / 0:35)

Today, we will be building the GameLib.biz app. GameLib.biz is a place for users to track their video game library and which games they've completed. 
We will also be using a Mongoose / Express back-end to allow for users to save their games.

### Back-End Setup

1. First, clone down [the
   back-end](https://git.generalassemb.ly/la-seir-9-8/gamelib-api),
   install dependencies, and open in VS Code.

2. Run the seeds file to populate our MongoDB database with game data.

```bash
node seed.js
```

3. Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

> If you inspect `package.json`, you will see that this is an alias for `nodemon server.js` in the "scripts" object

4. Navigate to `localhost:4000/api/v1/games` to see the response from our server. You should see a message that says: "Incomplete games#index controller function". 

5. In `controllers/games.js` all CRUD functionality has been stubbed out but is currently incomplete. Complete the `index` function with the following:

```js
const index = (req, res) => {
    db.Game.find({}, (err, foundGames) => {
        if (err) console.log('Error in games#index:', err)
        
        if(!foundGames) return res.json({
            message: 'No Games found in database.'
        })

        res.status(200).json({ games: foundGames });
    })
}
```

> The code we added will return a JSON response to the client that we can use to save or display the data as necessary.

6. Navigate to `localhost:4000/api/v1/games` to see the response from our server now. You should see an array of 10 game objects from our database in JSON format. If you don't, debug before moving on.

7. Complete the `show` function so that it too sends back a single JSON game object when a request is made to `localhost:4000/api/v1/games/<ValidGameIdHere>`. 

8. To implement the `create` method we first need to modify `server.js` to parse any JSON included with a POST or PUT request and save it within `req.body` for our access in the associated controller function. Uncomment line 9 of `server.js` to enable express's built-in body parsing capabilities. 

9. Modify the `create` function in `controllers/games.js` to the following:

```js
const create = (req, res) => {
    db.Game.create(req.body, (err, savedGame) => {
        if (err) console.log('Error in games#create:', err)

        // Validations and error handling here

        res.status(201).json({ game: savedGame })
    })
}
```

> Any function that modifies data in the database really should be protected with validations and comprehensive error handling. We don't have the time to add it now but here in the controller is one place where we can make sure the user is saving the data we need.

10. Spend 15 minutes completing the `update` and `destroy` methods (using similar techniques that we used with the `index`, `show`, and `create` routes). Test all of the routes with your favourite HTTP Request tool (like Postman or `curl`). 

### Front-End Setup

1. In a ***separate terminal window/tab***, clone down [the React GameLib
   app](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-SEI/gamelib-client)
2. Install dependencies, and open in VS Code.
3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

> If you inspect `package.json`, you will see that this is an alias for `react-scripts start`

3. Navigate to `localhost:3000` to ensure the app is up and running. Take 5 minutes to familiarize yourself with the starter code.

4. We want our users to see a list of games served from the database (keep it running in another window or tab of your terminal app). Let's start by adding a Route in `config/routes.js`.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

import Home from '../pages/Home'
import GameList from '../pages/GameList'

export default (
  <Switch>
    <Route exact path='/' component={ Home } />
    <Route path='/games' component={ GameList } />
  </Switch>
)
```

> We import `GameList` even though it doesn't exist and you may see an error  we'll fix that right now.

5. Create `/src/pages/GameList.js` and get a boilerplate class-based component in place.

6. The `GameList` component is going to be our first to make a request to the backend through our helper functions. Build out the component with the following code:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import GameModel from '../models/game'

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
import GameCard from '../components/GameCard'

class GameList extends Component {
  state = {
    games: []
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.fetchData()
  }

  fetchData = () => {
    GameModel.all().then(data => {
      this.setState({ games: data.games })
    })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>All Games</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default GameList;
```

7. In `/models/game.js` add the method we invoke in the `GameList` component.

```js
  static all = () => {
    // the fetch API will not parse JSON in the response automatically so we handle it in the first .then()
    return fetch(`${url}/games`).then(res => res.json())
  }
```

> What is the `static` keyword here for?

8. We won't see a list of games in state quite yet. What we will see is a CrossCORS error in the browser's console. Let's take a break to discuss that.

## Two-Server Architecture (30 min / 1:15)

Currently we are using this type of architecture. Our back-end is running on
`localhost:4000` while our front-end is running on `localhost:3000`. One way to
say this is that these applications have different "origins". One issue with
this is that our browser is not going to like requests from our front-end
(served by `localhost:3000`) to our back-end on `localhost:4000`. In the
application, navigate to the Game List view and check the console. You
should see:

```
XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:4000/api/v1/games. No 'Access-
Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin
'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access.
```

This is Chrome telling us that since our back end is running on a separate port
("origin") than our front end, our front end is not allowed to retrieve data
from it. To fix this, we need to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
on our back-end.

### Installing `cors` in Express

1. Stop your Express server, and install `cors` via npm:

```bash
npm install cors
```

2. In `index.js`, require the `cors` module and integrate with Express:

```js
const cors = require('cors')
```

```js
app.use(cors())
```

3. Restart your Express server:

```bash
npm start
```

Now when you navigate to `localhost:3000/games`, you should see an array of games 
being retrieved from our API and stored in `GameList`'s state.

> Note: The default `cors` configuration (above) will allow requests from
> **any** origin (which may or may not be ideal). To more precisely control
> access to our API, we would need to do little more configuration. Check out
> the [cors documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) for more
> information on this process.

### Complete the GameList Component

1. Let's display each game on the GameList page. Refactor your `render` function to the following:

```js
  render() {
    let gameList = this.state.games.map((game, index) => {
      return <h1 key={index}>{ game.title }</h1>
    })

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>All Games</h1>
        { this.state.games ? gameList : 'Loading...' }
      </div>
    );
  }
```

> We're **conditionally rendering** the game titles once we know the data from our API is safely in state. This will show a "Loading..." message until the array of games in state has some value and is no longer empty. Once that is true, we render the titles for each game.

### Single Game Page

1. A list of game titles is fine but our users will want to do more than see some text. Let's refactor those `<h1>` elements to render individual `GameCard` components. The GameCard component should display the title, publisher, and the coverArtUrl but how it is laid out is up to you. 

2. With a working GameCard component rendering to the GameList page, we can now start to build a single detail page for each game. Let's make each GameCard component a clickable link. In the render function of `GameList.js`:

```js
let gameList = this.state.games.map((game, index) => {
  return (
    <Link to={`/games/${ game._id }`} key={index}>
      <GameCard  {...game} />
    </Link>
  )
})
```

For every `<Link>` component, we need to add a `<Route />`. React Router can handle dynamic URLs and does so in a way we are already familiar with by allowing path names to look like `/games/:id` in the Route component. Add this to `routes.js`:

```js
import GameShow from '../pages/GameShow'
...
<Route path='/games/:id' component={ GameShow } />
```

3. The GameShow component will be up to you to build out. Here are the requirements:

```
- it must use a static method from the GameModel 
- it must fetch a single game from the database using the ID
- it must conditionally render a GameCard component and pass it all required props
```

> Hint: Look for the game's ID in the props passed to each component rendered through a <Route />. You can find the id in the `match` props.

4. Our last step together will be to build out the functionality for a user to create a new game. We'll type this out together, but here is the final code for this component. In a new file, `/pages/NewGame.js`, add:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import GameModel from '../models/game'

class NewGame extends Component {
  state = {
    title: '',
    publisher: '',
    coverArtUrl: '',
    completed: false  
  }

  handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    GameModel.create(this.state)
      .then(data => {
        this.props.history.push('/games')
      })
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    if (event.target.type !== "text") {
      this.setState({ completed: !this.state.completed })
    }

    this.setState({
      [event.target.name]: event.target.value
    })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>New Game</h2>
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          <div className="form-input">
            <label htmlFor="title">Title</label>
            <input 
              type="text" 
              name="title" 
              onChange={this.handleChange}
              value={this.state.title} />
          </div>
          <div className="form-input">
            <label htmlFor="publisher">Publisher</label>
            <input 
              type="text" 
              name="publisher" 
              onChange={this.handleChange}
              value={this.state.publisher} />
          </div>
          <div className="form-input">
            <label htmlFor="coverArtUrl">Image URL</label>
            <input 
              type="text" 
              name="coverArtUrl" 
              onChange={this.handleChange}
              value={this.state.coverArtUrl} />
          </div>
          <div className="form-input">
            <label htmlFor="completed">Completed</label>
            <input 
              type="checkbox" 
              id="completed" 
              checked={this.state.completed} 
              onChange={this.handleChange} />
          </div>

          <input type="submit" value="Save!"/>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default NewGame;
```

As we've seen before, here our component renders a form for our user to interact with. This form has **controlled inputs**, in other words, input elements where the value is tied directly to state and only modified through changing state. A separate `onSubmit()` method is called when the form's submit button is pressed. We stop the default submit behaviour from happening and instead make the request through our model file. Let's write the fetch statement that will send our form data to the API as JSON.

And in `/models/game.js` add:

```js
class GameModel {
  ...
  static create = (gameData) => {
    return fetch(`${url}/games`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(gameData)
    })
      .then(res => res.json())
  }
}
```

### Complete Functionality

Time permitting, work through the following features until your GameLib app allows a user full CRUD functionality.
- on the GameList page, a user should be able to press a button to delete a game from the DB and be immediately shown an updated list of games.
- on the GameCard component, a user should be able to toggle an edit form, provide new values for the game, and save their changes.
- find an image of a badge online and display it on the GameList page for each game the user has completed

## Bonus

### Deploying to Separate Domains

Now that our front end and back end are communicating properly, let's look at
how we would deploy them.

#### Back End Deployment

As our back-end will need to be hosted on a server and host a database, we will
want to deploy it to a hosting service like Heroku.

We would go about this no differently than we have
previously.

Make sure you're logged into the heroku cli:

```bash
heroku login
```

Then create a new heroku application:

```bash
heroku create react-gamelib-api
```

> Note: `heroku create` creates the application and sets up the remote
> [(documentation on this)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/creating-apps)

> If everyone runs this at the same time it may throw an error. Try adding your initials to the end to make it unique.

Next, we want to create a new database on [Mongo
Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com). Once you've created a new database, create
a user for that database. Then, in your terminal (inserting the data for your
Atlas db):

```bash
heroku config:set DB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0-ru2re.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true"
```

> Be sure to replace <username> and <password> with your database username and
> password

Finish setting up your database. Then, push our app to Heroku:

```bash
git push heroku microservice-solution:master
```

Then seed the database:

```bash
heroku run node db/seeds.js
```

#### Front-End Deployment

Now that our back-end is deployed to Heroku, we need to update our front-end with the correct URLs in our axios requests. Right now, axios is requesting data from our local server:

```js
axios.get('http://localhost:4000/api/translations')
```

Update your axios request with your Heroku URL and `'/api/transtations'` For example:

```js
axios.get('<insert Heroku URL here>/api/translations')
```
> To quickly get access to your back-end Heroku URL, run `heroku open` in the terminal of your back-end repo and copy the URL from your browser.

Currently, when we start our React application locally, we are using
`react-scripts`. `react-scripts` is the black box that contains all of the major
dependencies and configuration that we are using in development:

* Dependencies: Babel, Webpack, and ESLint and other dependencies that allow the
  use of JSX, hot reloading, compilation of our application, and other features.
* Configuration: Configuration files for the above dependencies that control
  (among other things) how our app is compiled in both development and
  production environment.
* Scripts: Commands that allow us to do things like start our Webpack server
  (`react-scripts start`) or create a compiled, minified version of our
  application (in vanilla JS) that can be deployed (`react-scripts build`).

> Source code on `react-scripts` [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts).

The command that we will need to use for deploying our front-end is
`react-scripts build`. `create-react-app` automatically aliases this for us in
our `package.json` as `npm run build`. In the terminal, run this command to
create a deployment-ready version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a directory called `build` in the root of your application.
This directory contains all of your application's HTML, minified JS, and
minified CSS in a deployment-ready format.

Now all you would need to do is to deploy **the build directory** to a static
asset hosting service (such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or
[surge](https://surge.sh/).

If pushing to gh-pages:

```bash
git subtree push --prefix build origin master:gh-pages
```

> Note that `subtree` allows us to only push a sub-directory of our repository
> instead of the entire app. [More
> Information](https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490)

> Pro move: create a `deploy` npm script for your deployment command.

If using surge:

```bash
npm install -g surge
surge ./build
```

> [Surge](https://surge.sh/) is a CLI based npm package that lets you quickly
> deploy static front-end applications for free.
